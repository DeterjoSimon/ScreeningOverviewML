This is a repository aimed at implementing ML algorithms to predict scientific papers relevance based on Title+Abstract.

## Feature extraction algorithms to consider
From most performant to least, based on emprical evidence and research:

1. Pre-traiend word embeddings such as Word2Vec or GloVe.

2. Deep learning-based methods such as CNNs or RNNs. 

3. TF-IDF

4. Bag-of-words

5. N-grams

## Algorithms to consider
1. Naive Bayes
2. SVM
3. Logistic Regression 
4. Gradient Boosting
5. Random Forest
